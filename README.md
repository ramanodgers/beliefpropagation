# beliefpropagation
A snapshot of work investigating belief propagation decoders for classical codeword, classical syndrome, quantum syndrome, and neural quantum syndrome contexts. Much of the background work was done before the github repository. Additionally, later work using protected IP is not visible. 

## demo
A demonstration of various decoders is hosted on huggingface: [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ramanodgers/BeliefPropagationDemo). The source files are also stored in the demo subfolder in this github repo. 

## QuantumBP 
Notebook hosting syndrome-based decoding algorithms for error correction. Further documentation within the notebook.

## ClassicBP 
Initial codeword-based decoding work, using the belief propagation framework. Further documentation within the notebook.
